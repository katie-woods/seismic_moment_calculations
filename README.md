# Fault plane seismic moment calculations
Eventually this repo will contain a bunch of scripts that can be used in seismic moment calculations.

Functions will include calculations of:

- Area based on shape of fault planes (rectangular or circular)
- Seismic moment from moment magnitude
- Moment magnitude from seismic moment
- Displacement from moment magnitude and fault dimensions
